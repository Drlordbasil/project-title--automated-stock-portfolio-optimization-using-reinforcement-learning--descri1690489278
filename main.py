# 1. Import Optimization

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
import gym

# 2. Data Collection

# Fetch historical stock price data from reliable sources
# and preprocess it for analysis
stock_data = pd.read_csv('stock_data.csv')
# Preprocess the data as required

# 3. Feature Engineering

# Extract market indicators, news sentiment, economic indicators,
# and market trends from the raw stock data
moving_average = stock_data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
volatility = stock_data['Close'].rolling(window=20).std()
trading_volume = stock_data['Volume']

# Perform other feature engineering tasks as required

# Combine features into a single dataframe
features = pd.concat([moving_average, volatility, trading_volume], axis=1)

# 4. Reinforcement Learning Model

# Train a model using Reinforcement Learning to learn optimal
# portfolio allocation strategies based on a reward system
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu',
                          input_shape=(features.shape[1],)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(features, returns, epochs=10)

# 5. Portfolio Optimization

# Continuously update and optimize the portfolio allocation
# based on changing market conditions
new_portfolio = model.predict(current_portfolio)

# 6. Visualization and Reporting

# Provide intuitive visualizations and reports to help investors
# understand the portfolio's performance and composition
# Display key metrics like Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown,
# and portfolio value over time

# Generate visualizations

# Generate reports

# Main function

# Fetch stock data
stock_data = fetch_stock_data()

# Extract features from stock data
features = extract_features(stock_data)

# Prepare returns data for portfolio model training
returns = stock_data['Return']

# Train the portfolio optimization model
portfolio_model = train_portfolio_model(features, returns)

# Load current portfolio allocation
current_portfolio = np.array([0.2, 0.3, 0.5])  # Example allocation

# Continuously optimize the portfolio
new_portfolio = optimize_portfolio(portfolio_model, current_portfolio)

# Generate visualizations and reports
